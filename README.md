# BUS216F-Final-Project---Yu-Ding
This is the repository for Brandeis University BUS216F Final Project, and the owner is Yu Ding.

Here I built a connect-4 game using python's pygame package. The size of the board is 6*7 (6 rows and 7 columns).
There are 2 players in this game, player 1 goes first and then comes player 2, then player 1 again... until the winning condition for either player is met.
Players choose the column that he wants to drop a piece, and the piece will be dropped down to the very bottom space available in that specific column he chooses.
The winning condition is to have a 'connect 4' condition. 4 pieces connected in a row/column/diagonal.
When the winning condition is met, there will be a banner on the top of the screen to say which player wins the game.
